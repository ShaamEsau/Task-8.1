Founded in 2019, we are a community that loves to game. We don't have much tournaments or places we gamers can hang out and just enjoy some game talk or debates. We are lovers of games and all things related. Be it a casual side scroller like Mario Bros or competitive plays like Call of Duty, we're your guys and girls.
We're trying to expand the community so come join us for awesome gaming and bonding. Even though we sell games and equipment, right now we just a basic lounge with a few of the popular games. Visit our catalog page to check out what we have and store prices. We hosts tournaments as well and booked out the lounge for anyone interested in hosting tournaments

Here is a quote from one of the guys that frequent the lounge:

"The lounge is pretty awesome! The employees are chilled and the community is engaging. With tournaments and prizes to be won as well for their store tournaments it's really the place to be!"
